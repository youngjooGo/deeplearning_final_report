\section{Motivation}
The MCTS, which is used to make decisions in the game, must complete decisions in a limited amount of time for real-time game play. 
However, in order for MCTS to make good decisions, it is necessary to repeat a number of simulated plays, and when there are not enough simulated plays, a bad answer can be drawn. 
Therefore, parallelization of MCTS is necessary to obtain a high performance answer.
In this project, we will implement the 'DaVinci Code' MCTS to find features that are not suitable for the GPU through comparing GPU based application with CPU based application.
The Da Vinci code has a number of branch divergence and the the time taken to execute command depends on the branch.
In this project, we find the problems which the unsuitable GPU application causes.
We study features that make Da Vinci code-MCTS suitable for GPU compared to CPU based MCTS.
